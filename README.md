# Blinkaroo
 In today's digital era, prolonged screen time contributes to eye strain and discomfort. The absence of reminders and user-friendly solutions leads to a lack of adherence to the 20-20-20 ruleâ€”taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes. To address this, the "Blinkaroo" project seeks to create a clean and accessible website.
